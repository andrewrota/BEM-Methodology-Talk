<aside data-markdown class="notes">
    - BEM doesn't force you to pull out common patterns between blocks.
    - You could do it anyway, but this can couple components unnecessarily.

    - Ugly
    - Not using the cascade?  Not unique to BEM, but cascade should be used carefully
    and isn't always right.
