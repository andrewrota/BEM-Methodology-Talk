#  Mapping the UI


<aside data-markdown class="notes">

    -So we're looking for indepdendent entities in our application.
    At this point it's easiest to define these blocks based on visual and content clues.

    -What an stand on its own as complete,
    as self-contained, as location-independent.
    Keep in mind that this easier on some
    projects than it is on others.

    -Now there are different ways to split up the blocks on your site.  You can nest blocks,
    of course, but I'd suggest the first time around not worrying about that.
    Just focus on the obvious stand alone, self-contained modules.
    You can break out nested blocks later, but nested blocks can make things more complicated, especially at first.
